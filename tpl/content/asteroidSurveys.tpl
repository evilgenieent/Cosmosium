They include a few thousand near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), near-Earth comets, a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft, and meteoroids large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth. It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the planet. NEOs have become of increased interest because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose to Earth. These asteroids are generally not as large as some main-belt asteroids and make good candidates for asteroid mining because of the comparatively low amount of delta-v required to reach them.')

It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish its members from other asteroids in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids, Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident.')

Trojan objects are also sometimes called Lagrangian objects. Asteroids in this category may create energy-productive colonizations. Although it would generally take days or even weeks to reach these with current technology, it would be possible to generate energy from sunlight at them nearly continuously since they would (due to their considerable distance from Earth) be in almost constant sunlight.')
